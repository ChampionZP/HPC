Our goal:
train a model to predict the final state of a job

About feature:
off line features: configuration related
on line features:  running process related

Two-stage:
1. off line job clustering and model training
2. on line job failure prediction

Feature vector:
job_f = [userID, logical_job_name, scheduling_class, priority, num_tasks, different_machines_rest, requested_cpu, requested_memory, requested_disk, early_cpu_usage_avg, early_memory_usage_avg, early_IO_usage_avg, early_cpu_usage_CoV, early_memory_usage_CoV, early_IO_usage_CoV, TaskFailFlag, AttemptFailFlag, PastAttemptsFlag]

Current problem:
The datasets are isolated with each other. how to connect them together.

Solution:
Extract data of NameID and LogNameID in job_events datasets to task_events datasets
Resort task_events data by dictionary order {JobId, TaskIdInThisJob, TimeStamp}
